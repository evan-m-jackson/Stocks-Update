# Stocks-Update

This program notifies a user how their stocks are performing by texting them a percentage increase/decrease.  The percentage is based on the previous day's closing price and the closing price the day before that.

The program also will text the user 3 recent news articles from the company they have stocks in.  This will help the user determine if the stocks will continue to perform well or not.
